These compilers often provide library bindings to support accessing WebAPIs in the source language and accessing standard libraries on the web. As a result of this additional complexity, WebAssembly compilers face different challenges compared with traditional compilers of native langauges. These challenges can introduce new bugs into the compilers."}),(0,l.jsx)("p",{children:"In order to understand the characteristics of these bugs, we conduct two empirical studies. First, we perform a qualitative study on the bugs in the most widely used WebAssembly compiler, Emscripten. We investigate 146 bug reports from Emscripten that are related to the unique challenges that WebAssembly compilers face. Second, we conduct a quantitative study of 1,054 bugs in three open-source WebAssembly compilers, AssemblyScript, Emscripten, and Rustc/Wasm-Bindgen. We analyze these bugs along three dimensions: lifecycle, impact, and sizes of bug-inducing inputs and bug fixes. We believe our analysis results will shed light on opportunities to design effective tools for testing and debugging WebAssembly compilers."}),(0,l.jsx)("br",{}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["The data of our study can be found in the",(0,l.jsx)("a",{href:s,children:"\xa0project website and GitHub repo"}),"."]}),(0,l.jsx)("br",{}),(0,l.jsx)("br",{})]})]})}}}]);
